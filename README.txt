GeoWiz Application
By: Vlad Vitalaru & Besim Krnjic

This App is a location guessing game! Go through 21 randomly generated slides with different locations and guess which country it's located in!

We originally had text input for guessing, but we changed it to tap gestures on images of flags instead to make the app easier for users to interact with. We separated our logic in to a separate class to follow MVC. 



Overall this was a really fun app to work on and let our friends play and see what score they get.
Please tell us what score you got out of 21 when you grade and give feedback, we're curious!
